    <h1>Brain and Brawn - Level Making Guide</h1>

    <h3>Basics:</h3>
    <p>To create levels, go to <a href="test.html">test.html</a>, click past the title screen, and hit "Create Levels"</p>
    <p>Although you can create levels on your phone, it is recommended that you use a computer browser if you want to load/save level files.</p>

    <h3>Loading and Saving</h3>
    <p>Brain and Brawn levels are JSON files. To prevent bugs, it is recommended that you never edit the JSON files directly, and instead edit by loading into the editor and saving over your previous version. Note that the level editor doesn't let you set star requirements, but if you're bold you can do this inside the JSON (or just let me know).</p>
    <p>To load a level: Click the "choose a file" button above the game canvas. Select the JSON level file you want to load. If you load something other than a BnB level, the game will crash.</p>
    <p>To save a level: Click the SAVE disk button to open a new browser tab with a "Download" button. Press Download to save your level as a JSON file.</p>

    <h3>Tools and Brushes:</h3>

    <p>Special Objects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Brush Window (top left): Displays the currently selected brush.</li>
        <li>Play Button: Tap to play your WIP level. The game will crash if you have 2+ Brainy or 2+ Brawny.</li>
        <li>Eraser: Tap to select the eraser (Brush window will become empty). Tap on a tile to erase the sprite.</li>
        <li>SAVE: See loading/saving section above.</li>
        <li>Flip Diagonally: Flip your level diagonally. </li>
        <li>Flip Vetically: Flip your level vertically.</li>
        <li>**(NOTE: you can perform a horizontal flip with the following flip[ sequence: diagonal,vertical,digonal)**</li>
        <li>Adjust Square: Enter the "Adjust Menu"</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Brushes:</p>
    <p>To use a brush, tap on it to select it (note the Brush Window will change), then tap on the tile where you'd like to place that object.</p>


    <h3>Adjust Menu:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Left/Right: Adjust level width.</li>
        <li>Up/Down: Adjust level height.</li>
        <li>Boundary Death: TRUE by default. Set to FALSE to prevent Brainy/Brawny from flying out into space. This is useful if you want to quickly test/iterate on a level idea without creating walls around the border, but keep in mind that in the actual game this is always set to true. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Terms:</h3>
    <p><b>If any of the terms below you uncomfortable, please do not submit levels!</b></p>
